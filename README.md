# physics_models
Physics models are created using matplotlib library matplotlib.animation in Python 3.6
Equation of motion are obtained by Lagrangian principle and Newton's second law
The differential equations are solved by approximation techinque similar to RK2 and RK4 methods
provided conditions to be initial value problem
Approximation used by me 
Given second order differential equation
